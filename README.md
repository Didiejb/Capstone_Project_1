# Project Title: Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store

## Project Overview
This Data Analysis Project aims to generate insight into the sales performance of a Retail Store. By exploring the sales data and analysing the various parameters, I seek to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional performance and monthly sales trend. This would help make data-driven decisions and enable me tell a unique story with the insights gotten from the data.
